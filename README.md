# demo
Demo of from scratch C++ CBOW word embeddings trained on medical text. Type symptoms like “abdominal pain”, “burning”, or “bloody stools” and see the most similar concepts learned by the model even from just ~60 lines of training data! 100 % static, powered by precomputed cosine similarities. No GPU, no server side heavy tensor magic.
